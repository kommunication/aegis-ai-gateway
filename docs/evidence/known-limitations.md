# Known limitations of the evidence AEGIS produces

This page states, plainly, what the audit trail does **not** establish. It exists so
that an operator building an evidence package finds these limits here rather than
discovering them during an audit.

## 1. A checkpoint attests event integrity, not policy provenance

### The gap

A decision record names the rule that fired. It does **not** bind that decision to the
exact policy bundle and configuration in force at the moment it was made.

Concretely: a checkpoint proves that a set of audit events existed, in that order,
unaltered since sealing. It does **not** prove which version of `default.rego` was
loaded when those events were produced, nor which gateway configuration was active.

### Confirmed, and deliberate

Nothing in the gateway computes a configuration digest. There is no configuration hash
anywhere in the repository. Rego bundles are compiled from `configs/policies/`, but
they are **neither versioned nor digested**.

The control plane protocol reserves both field names,
[`ConfigHash` and `PolicyBundles`](https://github.com/aegis-gateway/aegis-ai-gateway/blob/ea72971186eb5c316966b065bf710f2d85f578b1/api/controlplane/v1/checkpoint.go#L160-L174)
in `api/controlplane/v1`, but their semantics are **unspecified in v1**, no v1 emitter
may populate them, and validation **actively rejects** a submission that does:

```
config_hash is reserved in v1: its semantics are unspecified and no v1 emitter may populate it
```

This is a considered decision, recorded in
[ADR 0004](https://github.com/aegis-gateway/aegis-ai-gateway/blob/ea72971186eb5c316966b065bf710f2d85f578b1/docs/adr/0004-reserved-fields-must-not-be-populated.md).
Declaring the fields merely *optional* would invite a future emitter to fill them with
something plausible, letting whoever populated them first define their meaning inside
what is supposed to be a contract. Reserving them keeps the name available for a v2 that
defines the semantics properly, while ensuring **nothing may be read into a v1
submission about the configuration in force when its events were produced**.

The docstring states the limit in one line, and it is the honest summary:

> A v1 checkpoint attests event integrity, not policy provenance.

### What this means in practice

**What a v1 checkpoint does support:**

- That a given decision was recorded, with its request ID, timestamp, outcome, and the
  deny reason text.
- That the event sequence is unaltered since sealing, via a Merkle root (RFC 6962) and
  a hash chain linking each checkpoint to its predecessor.
- Inclusion proofs for any individual event within a sealed range.

**What it does not support:**

- "This decision was made under policy bundle version X." The bundle is not versioned.
- "The gateway configuration was unchanged across this reporting period." No digest is
  computed, so no comparison is possible.
- Reconstructing, from the evidence alone, why a rule that exists today did or did not
  fire on a request from six months ago.

### Compensating controls available today

Until a v2 defines these fields, operators needing configuration provenance should bind
it externally:

1. Keep `configs/` under version control and record the deploying commit SHA in your
   release process. The gateway logs its `version` at startup.
2. Treat policy changes as deployments, so the deployment record is the provenance
   record.
3. Correlate by time: checkpoints carry `covered_from` / `covered_to`, which can be
   intersected with a deployment timeline. Note these are **intervals to be unioned,
   not a partition**, so an event's covered range may overlap several checkpoints.

None of these are as good as a digest in the payload. They are what is available.

### Roadmap position

Deferred to **control plane protocol v2**. Both field names are already claimed, so
defining them is an addition rather than a breaking change. Two pieces of work are
required, and the protocol is the smaller of them:

1. **In the gateway:** compute a stable digest over the loaded configuration, and
   version and digest each compiled Rego bundle. This does not exist in any form today.
2. **In the protocol:** define the semantics of `config_hash` and `policy_bundles` in
   v2, and lift the v1 validation rejection for v2 emitters.

`PolicyBundleRef` already anticipates the shape: a name **and** a content digest,
because a name can be reused for changed content, and an evidence bundle assembled years
later needs to say which bytes were in force.

### This has no bearing on the zero-retention claim

Stated explicitly, because the two are easy to conflate.

The provenance gap is about **what a decision record can be bound to**. Zero-retention is
about **what a decision record contains**. They are independent:

- The audit trail stores metadata only. That property is enforced by
  `TestNoPayload_SchemaIntrospection`, `TestNoPayload_FilterResultStruct`, and the
  `TestNoPayload_CanaryEndToEnd` canary test, none of which involve configuration
  hashing.
- Adding a config hash and bundle versions in v2 would add **more metadata** about the
  gateway, not any data about the request. It would not weaken zero-retention, and it
  does not currently strengthen it.

An auditor should treat these as two separate questions, and this page as the answer to
only the first.

---

## 2. Related limits worth stating in the same breath

These are not the provenance gap, but an operator reading this page will want them.

### 2.1 Requests are scanned; responses are not

Every filter implements `ScanRequest` and runs on the **inbound** request only. There is
no `ScanResponse` in the
[`filter.Filter`](https://github.com/aegis-gateway/aegis-ai-gateway/blob/ea72971186eb5c316966b065bf710f2d85f578b1/internal/filter/filter.go#L43-L47)
interface and no outbound filtering in the codebase. **Model output is not scanned** for
secrets, PII, or injection.

This is recorded prominently because the project has previously published a security
policy claiming response scanning that did not exist.

### 2.2 The default policy bundle denies on alias, not on provider trust

`configs/policies/default.rego` keeps RESTRICTED data off any alias not listed in
`restricted_cleared_aliases`, which is empty as shipped.

It deliberately does **not** test `input.request.provider_type`. That field is populated
from `adapter.Name()`, which reports the adapter implementation (`"openai"`,
`"anthropic"`) and never a trust boundary: `azure_openai` and `internal_vllm` both route
through the OpenAI adapter and both report `"openai"`. **There is currently no input field
that distinguishes an external provider from a self-hosted one.** Any rule of the form
`provider_type == "external"` compiles, reads correctly, and can never fire. An earlier
version of this bundle contained exactly that rule, so the shipped default denied nothing
at all until it was replaced.

If you need a genuine external/internal distinction in policy, encode it in alias names
and gate on `input.request.model`, as the default bundle now does.

### 2.3 Zero-retention is enforced behaviourally, and now partly structurally

`audit_logs.filter_results`, `audit_events.metadata` (both `JSONB`),
`audit_events.error_message` and `audit_events.user_agent` (both `TEXT`) carry **no
`CHECK` constraint, domain, or trigger**. Nothing in the schema prevents a future caller
from writing payload into them.

The guarantee rests on: no current code path writing payload there
(`filter_results` is written by nothing at all at this commit), a static test rejecting
payload-indicative **column names**, and the end-to-end canary asserting at runtime that
a payload string reaches no audit row, including JSONB, which the canary catches by
serialising each row to JSON text.

That is a real and testable guarantee. It is **not** the same as the schema making
payload storage impossible, and it should not be described as though it were.

### 2.4 The canary test runs in CI, and can no longer skip quietly

`TestNoPayload_CanaryEndToEnd` runs on every push, in a dedicated "Audit Conformance" job
that provisions Postgres and Redis, runs migrations, issues an API key, and starts a real
gateway.

It previously skipped when `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `TEST_SERVER_URL` or `TEST_API_KEY` were
absent, which meant a pipeline where it skipped looked identical to one where it passed.
It now **fails** with a message naming the missing variables; the only way to not run it is
`AEGIS_SKIP_INTEGRATION=1`, which is explicit and appears in the test output. The CI step
additionally greps for `--- PASS: TestNoPayload_CanaryEndToEnd` by name, because
`go test -run` exits 0 when its pattern matches nothing, so a rename would otherwise have
left the step green having run nothing.

A conformance test that can silently not run is worse than no test, because it
manufactures confidence. Both routes to that outcome are now closed.

### 2.5 Losing the Redis *address* is invisible on the health endpoint

The rate limiter's fail direction depends on which of two things went wrong, and the
asymmetry is deliberate: Redis configured but unreachable **fails closed**, and Redis not
configured at all **fails open** so a developer can run the gateway without one.

Both directions were tested on 2026-08-25 and both behave as documented
(`VERIFICATION.md` §6.1). The finding is about what an operator can see.

- Redis configured, server down: `/aegis/v1/health` reports `"status":"degraded"` with
  `"redis":{"connected":false,"circuit_breaker":"open"}`, requests get 503, and every
  refusal writes a `redis_failure` row to `audit_events`. This is loud, and correctly so.
- Redis **not configured**: `/aegis/v1/health` reports `"status":"healthy"` and omits the
  `redis` object entirely. Requests return 200 with rate-limit headers whose
  `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Requests` never decrements, because no counter exists.

So a deployment that loses its Redis *address*, through a dropped environment variable or
a bad config merge, serves traffic with rate limiting and daily spend budgets silently
disabled, behind a green health check. The fail-open path is intentional. Its
indistinguishability from a healthy configured deployment is not a property anyone chose,
and it is the failure mode most likely to survive unnoticed in production.

Until this changes, an operator who relies on rate limiting should assert on the presence
of the `redis` object in the health response, not just on `"status":"healthy"`, and should
treat a non-decrementing `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Requests` as an outage signal.


### 2.6 What the column bounds do and do not establish

Migration `012_bound_audit_text_columns` bounds the free-text columns on `audit_events`:
`error_message` to 128 characters, `user_agent` to 256, `ip_address` to 64, and the
`metadata` JSONB to 4096 bytes by CHECK constraint. `internal/audit/limits.go` clips every
value to those limits before the insert.

**What this establishes.** These columns cannot hold a document, a conversation, or a
transcript, and the limit is declared in the schema where a reader can check it in a few
seconds rather than asserted in prose they have to trust. Combined with the clipping, an
over-long value is now recorded truncated instead of costing the entire audit row.

**What it does not establish.** It does not make storing a prompt impossible. A
128-character prompt exists, and a bound tight enough to exclude every prompt would be
tighter than a legitimate browser `User-Agent`, which routinely runs past 200 characters. A
bound a real client trips is not a safety property, it is an audit-suppression bug.

So the bound raises the floor and narrows what a future mistake could retain. It is not a
proof that no payload can ever be stored, and it should not be described as one. The claim
that no payload *is* stored remains the behavioural one, tested by
`TestNoPayload_CanaryEndToEnd` and by the sweeps in `VERIFICATION.md` §5.3 and §6.3.

**`metadata` is now gone.** Migration 013 replaced it with twelve typed, bounded columns
and cut `hash_schema_version=2`. No column on `audit_events` is untyped or unbounded any
more, so the paragraph above now describes every column on the table rather than most of
them.

That change was possible in one release only because the migration refuses to run in a
database holding version-1 checkpoints: a version-1 leaf hash cannot be recomputed once
`metadata` is gone, so dropping it under an existing chain would have made every sealed
checkpoint permanently unverifiable. A database that has run 013 provably has no
version-1 chain, which is what lets the verifier compute one field set rather than two.

The integrity coverage is unchanged by this, and it is worth being precise about that.
Version 1 hashed the JSONB object, so its contents were already attested. Version 2 hashes
the same data as separate fields. The gain is typing and bounding, not more signed data.

### 2.7 Non-text content parts are refused, not filtered

`message.content` now accepts an array of content parts as well as a string. Only
`{"type": "text", "text": "…"}` is admitted. An `image_url`, `input_audio` or `file`
part returns HTTP 400 with `"code": "unsupported_content_part"`.

**This is a refusal, not a capability.** AEGIS cannot read an image. The secrets, PII
and injection filters operate on text, so an image part would be data that leaves the
gateway for a provider having passed through no filter at all. Widening `content` to
carry structured parts is what made image parts expressible for the first time;
admitting them as a side effect of that widening would have converted a compatibility
fix into a hole in the one claim this product is built on.

So an operator should read this as: **AEGIS does not support multimodal requests, and
says so at the gateway rather than forwarding what it cannot inspect.** If image
support is wanted it needs its own decision about what inspecting an image means, not
a struct field.

The refusal is asserted by `TestDecode_RejectsNonTextContentPart` and, through the
full handler, by `TestChatCompletions_RefusesImageContentPart`.

### 2.8 Some tool-calling constructs cannot be expressed against Anthropic

Tool calling now works on every shipped alias. The Anthropic adapter translates the
OpenAI tool surface in both directions, streaming included, against behaviour probed
from the live Messages API rather than a remembered schema
([the mapping](anthropic-tool-mapping.md) quotes the provider's own errors).

What does not translate is refused by name rather than approximated, because an
approximation is the same failure as a silent drop and harder to detect. Five
constructs are legal OpenAI and are rejected with a 400 naming the construct:

1. **A tool call the conversation never answers.** Anthropic requires every
   `tool_use` to be followed immediately by its `tool_result`.
2. **Anything between a tool call and its result.** This is the one an agent is
   most likely to hit: OpenAI tolerates an interleaved message, Anthropic does not,
   so a conversation an OpenAI-backed agent built happily can be rejected when the
   same conversation is replayed against an Anthropic route.
3. **A tool result answering no call in the preceding turn.**
4. **`strict: true` on a tool whose schema does not set `additionalProperties:
   false`.** Anthropic requires it. AEGIS will not rewrite a caller's schema to
   satisfy the provider, because the rewritten request is not the one they sent.
5. **Tool call arguments that are not valid JSON.** OpenAI carries arguments as an
   opaque string; Anthropic carries an object, so a malformed string has nowhere to go.

**What an operator should take from this.** The first three are properties of the
conversation an agent constructs, not of the gateway's configuration, and an agent
that switches between an OpenAI route and an Anthropic one may produce a history that
only one of them accepts. That is a real portability limit between providers, and
AEGIS surfaces it at the gateway with a named error rather than passing through an
opaque provider 400.

**One thing this does not do.** `is_error` on a tool result has no OpenAI equivalent.
Nothing is lost in the direction AEGIS translates, since it never sets the flag, but a
tool failure signalled Anthropic-side cannot be represented if the ingress direction is
ever added.
### 2.9 Streaming cost is recorded, and what still is not priced

Cost comes from provider-reported usage rather than a local estimate, so tool
definitions, tool call arguments and tool results are all accounted for with no work
on the gateway's part.

Streaming used to be the exception, and badly: a streamed request recorded zero
tokens and zero cost while the same request unstreamed recorded real figures. The
daily spend budget is computed from those rows, so streamed traffic moved no budget
at all. Both adapters now report usage on a stream, Anthropic from its native
`message_start` and `message_delta` events and OpenAI because the gateway sets
`stream_options` for itself.

**Cached input is priced at the cached rate.** Both adapters report the cached subset
of the prompt and both cost paths apply `cached_input`, which several models set an
order of magnitude below `input`. That was not true until 2026-08-29: the rates were
configured, `cost.Calculator` implemented them, and nothing ever populated the count,
so every cache read was billed at the full input rate.

Two things remain worth knowing.

**The two providers disagree about what a prompt count means, and the adapters
normalise.** Anthropic's `input_tokens` excludes anything served from or written to
the cache; OpenAI's `prompt_tokens` includes the cached portion and reports it as a
subset. AEGIS follows OpenAI's convention throughout, so a caller sees one meaning.
Verified against the live API: a cached Anthropic call returned `input_tokens` 8
alongside `cache_read_input_tokens` 4411, for a prompt of 4419 tokens.

**Cache writes are priced at the published write rate**, five-minute and one-hour
tiers separately, as of 2026-08-29. They were previously billed as ordinary input
because `cost.Calculator` had no field for the configured rate.

Fixing that surfaced a data error worth recording, because it is the reason the
validation now checks ratios rather than presence. Every Anthropic `cache_write_5m`
value in `configs/pricing.yaml` was a factor of ten low: 0.625 where the published
rate is 6.25, and the same slip on all four models. Coverage validation had nothing
to say about it, since each row had *a* price. `TestAnthropicCacheRatesMatchPublishedMultipliers`
now checks every Anthropic row against the published multipliers (a five-minute
write is 1.25x input, a one-hour write 2x, a read 0.1x), deriving its scope from the
file so a model added later is covered without anyone remembering.

**The cached count is not persisted.** `usage_records` stores `prompt_tokens` without
the breakdown, so the split is visible in the response and in the cost, but a later
reconciliation against a provider bill cannot see how much of a request was cached.
Adding it is a migration, and nothing else needs one right now.

### 2.10 Tool names are not in the audit record

`input.request.tools_offered` and `input.request.tools_called` are exposed to Rego, and
tool counts appear on the completion log line. **Neither is written to `audit_events`.**

So the audit trail records that a request happened and, if it was denied, why. It does
not record which capabilities were put in front of the model. For an agent workload
that is a real gap: "a call was made" and "a shell tool was offered and called" are
different facts, and only the first is in the evidence.

Arguments and results are payload and stay out; `internal/audit/tool_no_payload_test.go`
tests that boundary rather than asserting it.

**The reason for the deferral changed on 2026-08-30, and the earlier reason no longer
applies.** It used to be cost: adding a field requires a `hash_schema_version` bump, and
spending one on additive metadata was a bad trade. That bump has now happened, for
[ADR 0006](../adr/0006-predecessor-identity-is-not-hash-bound.md) and the outcome fields
in §2.14, and tool names still did not ride it.

They did not because the safety argument does not survive inspection. It rested on a tool
name being "metadata of the same kind as `model`". The `model` column was later hardened
so that **only a configured alias is ever sealed**, precisely because an arbitrary model
string let a caller write into the sealed chain. Tool names have no equivalent allowlist:
the caller chooses them, bounded only by validation at 128 names of 64 characters, so
sealing them would admit up to **8 KB per request** of caller-controlled text into an
immutable record that leaves the deployment.

This repository already treats a tool name that way elsewhere.
`TestValidationErrorsDoNotEchoScannedValues` exists to keep tool names out of error bodies
and log lines, on the grounds that a label built from one would copy a credential into
both before anything had looked for one. Sealing is a stronger commitment than logging:
logs rotate, and the chain is exported.

The evidentiary gap above is real and unresolved. Closing it needs a decision about the
zero-retention boundary and a mitigation of its own, not a rider on someone else's version
bump: a hard clip in the logger rather than only in the validator, digests instead of
names, or sealing only tools drawn from a configured allowlist, which is the answer `model`
arrived at. Recorded in the amendment to
[ADR 0011](../adr/0011-tool-names-wait-for-a-hash-schema-bump.md). Doing it now costs a
`hash_schema_version=4`.

### 2.11 `audit_logs` was never written, and has been removed

`audit_logs` was created by migration `002_create_audit_logs` and **nothing ever
inserted into it**. A repository-wide search found the table in that migration, in
`internal/audit/reader.go`, and in the purge code, and nowhere else. The per-request
decision record lives in `audit_events`, which is the table the sealer covers.

`GET /aegis/v1/audit/logs` was retired on 2026-08-29 and now returns **410 Gone** with a
body naming `GET /aegis/v1/audit/events` as the replacement. Until then it returned an
empty list, and in `?format=csv` it emitted a full 21-column header before the empty
body, so an operator exporting the decision record received a well-formed file with no
rows. That reads as "no activity in this window", which is a worse failure than an error:
it answers the question incorrectly instead of declining to answer.

The endpoint still authenticates and still refuses an unscoped or sentinel-organization
key, unchanged. Nothing behind it reads a row, so scoping has nothing left to protect,
but the access check was kept rather than dropped as a side effect of the deprecation.

**Removed on 2026-08-30 by migration `017_drop_audit_logs`**, together with
`Reader.QueryLogs` and the `LogRow` type, which is how this section said it should be done:
the table and its reader go together or not at all.

The migration refuses to drop a non-empty table. Nothing in this repository can have filled
it, but "provably empty" is a claim about this repository and not about whatever else may
have been pointed at the database, so it checks rather than asserts. A refusal leaves the
schema untouched because golang-migrate runs the migration in a transaction, and marks
version 17 dirty exactly as a refused migration 013 marked 13; clear it with
`UPDATE schema_migrations SET version=16, dirty=false`. Running the file through `psql`
directly does **not** give that protection, because psql commits each statement separately
and the `DROP` would still run after the exception.

`purge --table audit_logs` now refuses with a message naming `audit_events`, rather than
reporting a successful purge of zero rows. That would have been the same failure the
retired endpoint had, where an empty result read as "no activity" instead of "this does not
exist". `--table both` means `audit_events`, which is all it can now mean.

The endpoint stays at 410. It was retired on 2026-08-29 and the table went a day later, so
a client that has not been updated still gets an explanation rather than a 404.

What a reader should take from this, for any export made before the removal: the absence of
rows in `audit_logs` was never evidence about traffic. It never held anything.

### 2.12 Provider error bodies reach the process log, bounded

When a provider returns a non-200, the gateway logs an excerpt of the response body so an
operator can tell a bad API key from a rate limit from a malformed request. Until
2026-08-29 it logged the body **verbatim**, at `ERROR` level, on both the streaming path
(`internal/gateway/streaming_enhanced.go`) and, indirectly, the non-streaming one, where
`internal/router/adapters/openai.go` wrapped the whole body into an error that
`internal/gateway/handler.go` then logged.

Provider error bodies are unbounded strings the gateway does not control, and they
routinely quote the offending request back. So caller-supplied text could reach whatever
collects the process logs. The zero-retention claim is about prompts and responses
reaching durable storage, and a log shipper is durable storage.

`internal/redact.Excerpt` now bounds every such excerpt to 256 characters, collapses it to
a single line so a crafted body cannot forge additional log records, and drops control
characters. The status code, provider key and request ID are logged as separate fields,
which is the part an operator acts on.

**What this does not do.** It does not detect secrets or PII inside the excerpt, and it
should not be described as though it did. Up to 256 characters of provider-controlled
text, which may include a fragment of the caller's request, still reaches the log. The
mitigation is volumetric, not semantic. Treat gateway logs as containing incidental
third-party text, and set retention on them accordingly.

### 2.13 A custom Rego rule can place message text into the sealed record

Policy evaluation receives the caller's message text in full. `PolicyMessage.Content` in
`internal/filter/policy/opa.go` carries each message flattened to a string, and `Parts`
carries the structured form. That is necessary rather than incidental: a policy that
cannot see the content cannot make a decision about it.

The deny message a rule produces does not stay inside the evaluation. The path is:

1. Rego builds a deny string, joined by `concat("; ", deny)` in the shipped bundle.
2. `Evaluator.ScanRequest` concatenates it into `filter.Result.Message`.
3. `internal/gateway/handler.go` passes that as the `reason` argument to the audit logger.
4. `internal/audit/logger.go` writes it to `audit_events.reason`, clipped to 512
   characters by `MaxReason` in `internal/audit/limits.go`.

`audit_events` is the table the checkpoint sealer covers, and `reason` is one of the
twenty-six fields in the leaf hash at `hash_schema_version=2`
(`internal/audit/checkpoint/event.go`). So a deny message is hashed into the chain, served
by the audit read API, and cannot be edited afterwards without breaking verification.

A rule as ordinary as

```rego
msg := sprintf("blocked: %s", [input.messages[0].content])
```

therefore writes up to 512 characters of the caller's prompt into the attested trail,
permanently, in a table this project describes as holding no payload.

**This is operator-caused and the gateway does not prevent it.** The gateway cannot tell an
interpolated prompt from a literal string: both arrive as a deny message and both are
written. The zero-retention guarantee covers the code paths this project controls, and a
custom Rego bundle is not one of them. Nothing in the shipped configuration does this; the
default bundle interpolates only `input.request.model`.

**What an operator should do instead.** Return a rule *identifier*, not interpolated
content:

```rego
deny contains "restricted_data_on_uncleared_alias" if { ... }
```

That tells an operator which rule fired, which is the question a denial record has to
answer, and quotes nothing the caller sent. Interpolating a request *field* the operator
controls, such as `input.request.model` or `input.request.provider_type`, is fine: those
are metadata of the same kind as provider or status code. Interpolating message *content*
is not.

**Not enforced in code, deliberately.** Detecting whether a deny string contains caller
text would mean substring-matching every deny message against the request, which is both
expensive on the request path and unreliable, and refusing to seal a denial because its
message looked suspicious would drop a governance record for a heuristic. Making the
constraint enforceable is a design decision that has not been taken. Until it is, this is
a documented operator responsibility, and a Rego bundle that will be sealed deserves the
same review as any other code that writes to the audit trail.

### 2.14 What the allow event attests

`audit_events` records permitted requests as of 2026-08-29. `request_complete` is written
when a request passes every gate and completes; `provider_failure` when a request passes
every gate and then fails at the provider. Before this, only refusals were written, so the
sealed chain attested what was denied and nothing about what was allowed.

**What an allow event carries**, all of it in existing columns and therefore all of it
inside the leaf hash: `event_type`, `timestamp`, `request_id`, `organization_id`,
`team_id`, `user_id`, `api_key_id`, `api_key_prefix`, `endpoint`, `method`, `status_code`,
`provider` (the configured provider key, not the adapter type), `model` (the requested
alias), and `mode` (`stream` or `buffered`). A `provider_failure` additionally carries
`reason`, from a fixed set: `provider_unreachable`, `provider_error`, `stream_interrupted`,
`stream_truncated`, `stream_not_started`, `response_not_delivered`, `client_disconnected`.

`stream_truncated` is worth calling out. A provider that closes the connection cleanly
part way through a response produces EOF with no error, which is indistinguishable from a
finished stream except by the absence of the protocol terminator (`[DONE]` for
OpenAI-compatible providers, `message_stop` for Anthropic). The caller receives a partial
answer that looks whole. That is recorded as a failure rather than a completion.

**What `request_complete` actually claims.** The gateway wrote the full response without
error, and flushed it where the response writer supports on-demand flushing. That is the
strongest statement an HTTP handler can make, and it is deliberately weaker than "the
caller received it".

The flushing qualifier is not hypothetical hedging. Under net/http's own `ResponseWriter` a
flush is always supported and always performed; it is absent only behind a wrapper that
hides both `http.Flusher` and `Unwrap`, in which case the response is still written and
net/http still flushes it when the handler returns. The gateway records a completion there
rather than a failure, because nothing has gone wrong, but it has not confirmed a flush and
the contract does not pretend otherwise.

A successful flush proves the bytes were handed to the local kernel. It does not prove the
peer received them: a client that disconnects after the kernel accepts the write but before
the data is delivered or read produces a TCP reset that surfaces later, or never, and the
flush returns nil in that window. Remote receipt would need an application-level
acknowledgement, which an OpenAI-compatible client does not send. **Do not read a
`request_complete` row as proof the caller has the answer.** It is proof the gateway
produced and sent one.

Within that limit, both paths check what they can. On a stream, **every** chunk write and
flush is checked, not only the terminator: a failure part way through a response means it
was not written in full, and is recorded as an interruption even if a later terminator
succeeds. A terminator the gateway failed to write or flush does not establish completion
either, and neither does one processed on the same tick the caller went away. On a buffered
response the event follows a successful encode and flush; a failure is recorded as
`response_not_delivered`. The usage row is
written either way, because the provider did the work and the spend happened regardless.

`status_code` on any of these is **the status the gateway sent**, not what the provider
returned. A stream sends its 200 header before the first chunk, so a stream that later
fails was still a 200 on the wire; and when a provider returns a non-200 the gateway sends
500 rather than passing the upstream status through. The provider's own status is in the
logs. Recording it here would make the sealed row state something that never went out.

**Since 2026-08-30 it also carries the outcome, at `hash_schema_version=3`.** Migration 016
added `model_served`, `classification`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`,
`total_tokens` and `duration_ms`, and all six are inside the leaf hash. `audit_events` now
has thirty-two columns and all thirty-two are fields the version-3 leaf covers; that
correspondence is still exact, which is what makes "the row is attested" mean the whole
row.

`model_served` is the model the provider returned, as distinct from `model`, which remains
the alias the caller requested. The two differ whenever an alias resolves, and only the
first answers what actually ran. It is `null` when the provider never named one, which a
stream that ends before its first content chunk does: the routed model is known at that
point and is deliberately not substituted, because this column attests what the provider
reported rather than what the gateway intended to ask for.

All six are readable through `GET /aegis/v1/audit/events`, in JSON and in the CSV export. A
field that is attested but unreadable through the supported API cannot be checked by the
tenant it is attested for, and a version-3 leaf cannot be reconstructed without them.

Absent measurements are `null`, never `0`. A streamed response whose provider reported no
usage did not consume zero tokens, and a row saying so would attest a measurement nobody
took.

`duration_ms` behaves differently from the token counts, and the difference is deliberate.
The counts are provider-reported and absent when no provider reported any. The duration is
measured by the gateway itself, so it exists on every path that got far enough to fail: a
`provider_failure` carries it even though it carries no token counts, which is what lets
the record distinguish a provider that refused in three milliseconds from one that hung for
thirty seconds. A request completing in under a millisecond records `0`, which is a
measurement rather than an absence.

**All six are gateway- or provider-derived, which is why they can be sealed.** A column a
caller can write is a channel out of the zero-retention guarantee, as the `(unconfigured)`
sentinel on `model` records. That is also why tool names are **not** in version 3: they are
caller-chosen text, and the decision is described in §2.10 and in the amendment to
[ADR 0011](../adr/0011-tool-names-wait-for-a-hash-schema-bump.md).

The same bump bound `prev_checkpoint_id` into the checkpoint hash, addressing
[ADR 0006](../adr/0006-predecessor-identity-is-not-hash-bound.md) and
[issue #38](https://github.com/aegis-gateway/aegis-ai-gateway/issues/38). Doing both at once
was deliberate: the bump is the expensive part, and doing it twice costs twice.

That binding is narrower than it sounds and the ADR now says so explicitly. The checkpoint
hash is unkeyed, so an attacker with write access recomputes any digest; **no version makes
a rewritten chain detectable by a verifier working from the database alone**. What changed
is that the recorded ordering is now covered by the digest an external party holds, where
before it was the one structural field outside that commitment. External anchoring is still
required, exactly as before.

**A chain may hold version-2 and version-3 checkpoints together.** Migration 016 only adds
columns, and the version-2 leaf covers an explicit field list rather than the whole row, so
a version-2 leaf still recomputes byte-for-byte afterwards and `verify-chain --full`
verifies both. No deployment has to archive its chain to upgrade, which migration 013 did
require, because 013 dropped a hashed column and this one does not.

`estimated_cost_usd` was deliberately left out. It is derived from `pricing.yaml` at
request time, so a verifier reading the row later cannot recompute it once prices change:
sealing it would bind a number nobody can subsequently check. Cost for a given
`request_id` stays in `usage_records`, which is **not sealed**, along with the cached-token
detail. Joining the two still gives two different levels of assurance, and an assessor
should be told which half is attested.

**Loss visibility.** A failed audit write leaves no row, and what it leaves in the id
sequence depends on where it failed. That distinction matters operationally, so it is
worth stating exactly.

- **Rejected before the id is allocated**, which is the case for an over-long value in a
  bounded column: PostgreSQL coerces the parameter before evaluating the `BIGSERIAL`
  default, so the sequence does not advance and the ids stay contiguous. Measured. Nothing
  in the data records that anything was lost.
- **Failed after the id is allocated**, which covers the write timing out on the logger's
  five-second context, the connection dropping mid-statement, or any constraint checked on
  the formed row: `nextval` has already run and sequence increments are **not rolled back**
  by the aborted transaction, so the id is consumed permanently and a gap remains.

`aegis_audit_write_failure_total`, labelled by event type, is incremented in both cases and
is the only signal in the first. **Any non-zero value means the completeness claim does not
hold for that window.** Alert on any increase.

**A gap has a second consequence.** `checkpoint/sealer.go` deliberately refuses to seal
past an id gap, because an in-flight transaction may still commit into it. That is correct
for a gap that is about to close, and it means a permanently lost id **stalls sealing at
that point** until an operator intervenes. So a transient database failure during an audit
write can halt the checkpoint chain, not merely lose one row. Treat a sealer that has
stopped advancing, visible as a rising `aegis_audit_last_seal_age_seconds`, together with a
non-zero write-failure counter as that situation rather than as a sealer outage.

**Shutdown.** Audit writes are asynchronous so they never add latency to a request, which
means at SIGTERM there can be accepted events that are not yet persisted. `srv.Shutdown`
waits for handlers and knows nothing about those goroutines, so the gateway drains them
explicitly before closing the database pool and before any exit. The drain has its own
deadline, sized from the single-insert timeout rather than borrowed from the shutdown
budget, which a long-running stream can consume entirely. Before this, a routine rollout
could drop the tail of the decision record while every affected caller had received a 200.

**A forced shutdown still loses events, and this cannot be fixed by draining.** If the
graceful deadline expires with a handler still active, for example one blocked awaiting its
provider, that handler has not yet called the audit logger at all: it counts as zero
in-flight, the drain legitimately reports nothing outstanding, and the process then
terminates the handler before it can produce its event. Waiting instead would defeat the
deadline the operator configured, since a provider call can run for minutes. The gateway
therefore logs explicitly that the record is incomplete for whatever was in flight at exit,
rather than letting a successful drain imply otherwise. **Treat a `shutdown deadline
expired with handlers still active` line as a known gap in that window.**

**Volume.** `audit_events` now receives one row per request rather than one row per
refusal. Re-measured on 2026-08-30 against a 540,500-event corpus, ten times the original
sample, using `scripts/measure-audit-volume.sql` on PostgreSQL 16.14 with `fsync=on`:

| | 50,000 events | 540,500 events |
|---|---|---|
| Heap per row | 257.2 B | 257.2 B |
| Total per row, with indexes | 617.8 B | 651.1 B |
| Table size | 29 MB | 336 MB |

**A deployment serving a million requests a day should budget in the region of 600 MB a
day** of `audit_events` growth and plan retention accordingly. The measured range is 589 to
621 MB a day; the larger corpus confirms the original figure rather than revising it.

The seed inserts in strict timestamp order, which the gateway does not: `Logger.Log` starts
a goroutine per event (`internal/audit/logger.go:139-149`), so rows carry ascending
timestamps but reach the indexes in whatever order the pool schedules them. That reordering
is local rather than wholesale, and it costs slightly less rather than more. Permuting
within windows of 64 and 256 rows measures 648.7 and 645.4 bytes per row against 651.1 in
strict order, about 1 per cent. The default is the strict order because it is the
conservative end of that range; `jitter_window` reproduces the others.

Sealing and full verification are **linear**: 100,000 events seal in 2.20 s and 400,000 in
8.78 s, four times the corpus for 3.99 times the work, at roughly 45,000 events per second.
Verifying all 540,500 with `verify-chain --full` takes 11.87 s. A checkpoint row is
215.0 bytes and stays that size at every corpus size, because it holds digests rather than
content; 55 checkpoints occupy 112 kB.

**Two figures behave differently and should not be quoted interchangeably.** Heap per row
is a property of the event and is invariant: 257 bytes across an eleven-fold change in row
count. A real gateway-written completion measures 231 bytes against this seed's 246, the
seed carrying longer request and organisation identifiers, so it errs high. The
with-indexes figure is not a property of the event at all. It depends on the width of the
indexed values, on how many distinct API keys the traffic uses, and on insertion order,
since five of the seven indexes on `audit_events` are ordered by `timestamp DESC`
(`migrations/005_create_audit_events.up.sql:27-32`). Seeding 50,000 events in descending
timestamp order measures 552.1 bytes per row where ascending measures 617.8, on
byte-identical heap data.

That sensitivity is why two earlier ad hoc measurements of this quantity disagreed by a
factor of 1.4, one of them reporting 429 bytes per row, which would have cut the retention
budget by a quarter had it been adopted. The seed is committed for that reason: quote the
with-indexes number only from a run of that harness, or quote the heap figure, which is
stable. The harness refuses to seed a non-empty table, because dividing whole-table size by
whole-table count across a mixed corpus reports a figure for neither.

### 2.15 A revoked or expired key keeps working for up to five minutes

`internal/auth.CachedKeyStore` caches key metadata in Redis for five minutes
(`redisCacheTTL`). On a cache hit `Lookup` returns the stored metadata directly and
**nothing re-validates it**: the `status = 'active' AND expires_at > NOW()` filter lives in
`lookupDB`, which a cache hit never reaches, and the middleware does not check `ExpiresAt`
afterwards.

So for up to five minutes after the change:

- A **revoked** key still authenticates.
- An **expired** key still authenticates.
- A **tightened allowlist** is not enforced; the key keeps the models it had.

There is no invalidation hook. `cost.Calculator.InvalidateCache` exists for pricing and has
no counterpart here, so an operator revoking a credential during an incident cannot make it
take effect immediately except by flushing the cache or running without Redis.

**Stop the cache writers first, then flush every generation.** Both halves are required.

*Every generation*, because the prefix is versioned and has changed twice: `aegis:key:`
before 2026-08-30, then `aegis:key:v2:`, now `aegis:key:v3:`. During a rolling upgrade,
instances running older code read and write the older namespace, so clearing only the
newest deletes entries that may not exist yet while the old instances keep serving the
credential.

*Writers stopped*, because a flush concurrent with a running instance is racy. `Lookup`
reads PostgreSQL and writes Redis **afterwards**, so a request that read the key before it
was revoked can repopulate a namespace the flush has already cleared, and that entry
authenticates the revoked key for another five minutes. Draining the instances and
flushing again once they are gone closes the same window.

```
# after the pre-upgrade instances have stopped or drained
redis-cli --scan --pattern 'aegis:key:*' | xargs -r redis-cli DEL
```

A single flush against a live fleet reduces the exposure but does not end it. Verifying a
revocation still means observing a 401, not observing the flush.

This is long-standing behaviour rather than anything introduced recently, but two things
now depend on it being understood. Migration `015` revokes keys whose `allowed_models`
could not be read, expecting them to fail closed, and that revocation is subject to the
same delay. And the per-key model allowlist is now an enforced access control rather than a
display filter, so the delay applies to tightening it.

**What an operator should do.** Treat revocation as eventually consistent with a
five-minute bound. During an incident, flush the key cache rather than assuming a `revoked`
status is immediately effective. Verifying that a revocation has taken hold means observing
a 401, not observing the database row.

Closing this properly needs a design decision, an invalidation channel or a short-lived
version counter checked on every hit, and is deliberately not attempted here.

### 2.16 `keygen` used to mint keys that may use every configured model

**Fixed on 2026-08-30.** `cmd/keygen` wrote `allowed_models` as an empty JSON array and
offered no flag to populate it. An empty allowlist **permits every configured model**:
`modelAllowed` returns `true` when `len(allowed) == 0`
(`internal/gateway/model_allowlist.go:43-46`). The allowlist is opt-in per key, so every key
keygen issued was unrestricted and nothing said so at issue time.

`-allowed-models` is now required. It takes a comma-separated list of aliases, or the
literal `any` for an unrestricted key, so granting everything is something an operator types
rather than something that happens by omission. The value is validated against
`configs/models.yaml` when that file can be read: matching in the gateway is exact string
equality, so a misspelled alias would otherwise produce a key that authenticates and is
refused every model, and the operator would learn it from a caller rather than from the
tool. Where the config cannot be read, for instance running against a remote database from
elsewhere, the check is skipped with a warning rather than blocking the key.

The resulting allowlist is printed with the key.

**Keys issued before this date are unaffected and are unrestricted.** There is no migration
that could fix them, because an empty allowlist is indistinguishable from a deliberate
grant-all. Only someone who knows what a key is for can say which it is.

`aegis-migrate audit-keys` reports them:

```
$ aegis-migrate audit-keys
=== API keys that may use every configured model ===

  KEY PREFIX             NAME         ORG      TEAM      STATUS   CREATED     EXPIRES
  aegis-prod-v34com14    legacy-svc   acme     platform  active   2026-05-02  2027-05-02

  active keys:        4
  unrestricted:       1
  restricted:         3
```

It is read-only, issuing `SELECT`s and nothing else, so it is safe against a production
database. It exits 2 when any unrestricted key is found, so a scheduled run is visible
without parsing the text. `-org` scopes it to one tenant; `-include-inactive` also lists
revoked and expired keys, which are shown but never counted, because a key that cannot
authenticate is not exposure.

Restricting one is still a direct `UPDATE`:

Restricting an existing key is still a direct `UPDATE` against `api_keys`:

```sql
UPDATE api_keys SET allowed_models = '["aegis-fast"]'::jsonb
 WHERE key_prefix = 'aegis-prod-xxxxxxxx';
```

The value must be a JSON array of strings; migration `015` adds a `CHECK` that rejects
anything else. That rejection **leaves the existing row untouched and still active**, so a
malformed edit is a failed restriction, not a revocation: the key keeps the permissions it
had. On a database that predates the constraint, an unreadable value instead makes
`parseAllowedModels` fail closed, which denies the request at lookup while `status` stays
`active`. Neither path revokes anything. Verifying that a restriction took hold means
re-reading the row, not assuming the `UPDATE` succeeded.

Phase 1 did not change any of this; it changed what the field is *for*. The column was
previously a display filter, and it is now an enforced access control, so the grant-all
default carries a consequence it did not carry before: a key issued and forgotten is a key
that may reach every model in `configs/models.yaml`, including any added later.

The flag is required rather than defaulted because the safe default and the convenient
default point in opposite directions: any default that lets a key be issued without a
decision recreates exactly the situation this section described.
